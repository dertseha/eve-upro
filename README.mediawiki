== Project Structure ==

Although initially not intended, the Eclipse project ended up in a dedicated folder, so it's now eve-upro/eve-upro.
But I don't see too much of a problem with that - makes the readme stand out more.

== Used Tools for Development ==

I'm using
* Eclipse Indigo
** Plugins
*** for JavaScript development
*** for PHP development
*** MakeGood for PHP unit tests: http://redmine.piece-framework.com/
*** JsTestDriver for JavaScript unit tests: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/
*** PlantUML: http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/eclipse.html
* Node.js 0.8.2 (Live Runtime: 0.6.X)
* XAMPP 1.7.7

=== Testing folder structure(s) ===
==== eve-upro\test\** ====
These folder contain the external tests - i.e., they require the application running and available to provide
any dependent scripts.

===== eve-upro\test\js\** =====
Containing all the tests for the client scripts, based on the compressed export from the main application.
jsTestDriver is configured (see jsTestDriver.conf) to take the upro.js file from localhost.

Note: some tests are under a folder named 'longRunning'. These are taking more than a second to complete
and are thus also not listed in the jsTestDriver.conf file. When trying to execute them, test driver will
not continue and halt there.

===== eve-upro\test\php\** =====
This folder is meant to hold selenium based tests in PHP as I haven't found a working selenium driver for node yet.

===== eve-upro\test\manual\** =====
Holding various tests with visual interaction, prototypes and 

==== eve-upro\src\**\test\** ====
Tests based on nodeunit for the server side units.

eve-api has dedicated tests to be prepared as a dedicated package perhaps in the future.
